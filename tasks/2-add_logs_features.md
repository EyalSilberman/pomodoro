# What we want to achive
I add some new features and make small changes in the new logs we just implemented.

# How to achive this
1. add clear option to choose if you want the logs. think before implement how to make it right.
2. add to README to not afraid from the premitions you need to give - is from your own Google Script script to own Google Sheets without any third party involved
3. make that only first time the save setting and the fields are shown, after good success save- make `edit logs setting` button instead.
4. add to the README explanation to create Google sheet called `pomodoro logs` with the headers: session date |	sessions start | time |	session end time |	session type |	session duration | session completed. at A1, B1 and so on...

# Some extra data you will use

```
```

## Implementation Plan

After examining the current codebase, I've identified the following changes needed to enhance the logging features:

### Current System Analysis:
- `popup.html` - Contains Google Sheets configuration UI (always visible)
- `popup.js` - Manages settings save/load and validation
- `background.js` - Handles session logging with logSession() function that always runs
- Current logging data: Date, Start Time, End Time, Session Type, Duration, Completion Status

### Required Changes:

#### 1. Add Logging Toggle Option
- Need to add a checkbox for users to enable/disable logging
- Should be stored in chrome.storage.sync
- Background script should check this setting before logging

#### 2. Conditional Settings UI Display
- Show full settings form only when not configured or when editing
- After successful save, show compact "Edit Logs Settings" button
- Toggle between full form and compact view

#### 3. Update README Documentation
- Add reassurance about permissions (no third-party involvement)
- Add specific instructions for creating Google Sheet with proper headers
- Explain the security model

#### 4. Fix Diagnostic Issues
- Remove unused parameters in background.js message listener

### Files to Modify:
1. **Modify**: `popup.html` - Add logging toggle, restructure settings UI
2. **Modify**: `popup.js` - Add toggle logic, conditional UI display
3. **Modify**: `background.js` - Add logging toggle check, fix unused parameters
4. **Modify**: `README.md` - Add permissions reassurance and sheet setup instructions

### Detailed Implementation Tasks:

#### Phase 1: Add Logging Toggle
- [ ] Add "Enable Session Logging" checkbox to popup.html
- [ ] Add CSS styling for the toggle
- [ ] Add toggle state management in popup.js
- [ ] Update background.js to check logging enabled state before logging

#### Phase 2: Conditional Settings UI
- [ ] Restructure popup.html to have collapsible settings section
- [ ] Add "Edit Logs Settings" button for configured state
- [ ] Add show/hide logic in popup.js
- [ ] Update save success flow to hide settings form

#### Phase 3: Update Background Script
- [ ] Add logging enabled check in logSession() function
- [ ] Fix unused parameters diagnostic issues
- [ ] Update storage keys to include logging toggle state

#### Phase 4: README Updates
- [ ] Add permissions reassurance section
- [ ] Add detailed Google Sheet setup instructions with headers
- [ ] Update setup workflow to include sheet creation step
- [ ] Clarify security model (no third-party involvement)

### Dependencies:
- Phase 1 and 2 can be developed in parallel
- Phase 3 depends on Phase 1 (needs toggle state)
- Phase 4 can be done independently

### Estimated Impact:
- **Medium**: UI changes will be noticeable but not disruptive
- **Low**: Core timer functionality remains unchanged
- **High**: Better user experience and clearer documentation

### Implementation Strategy:
1. **User Control**: Add clear toggle for logging preference
2. **Progressive Disclosure**: Show complex settings only when needed
3. **Clear Documentation**: Reassure users about permissions and security
4. **Proper Data Structure**: Guide users to create properly formatted sheets

### Google Sheet Headers (as specified in task):
- A1: session date
- B1: sessions start time  
- C1: session end time
- D1: session type
- E1: session duration
- F1: session completed
