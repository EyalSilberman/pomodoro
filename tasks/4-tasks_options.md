# What we want to achive
now we add some functionality to the task manager - the user can manage tasks in a more interactive way.

# How to achive this

7. every task has status - or before start, or current (in progress, always only one in this state) or done. implement this.
8. every working session (25 min) has his own task.
9. log also the task name to the logs sheet.
10. show the current task name in the popup.
11. when hover on the title show the task description (from the tasks table).

# Some extra data you will use
```
those was the latest changes we implement in the tasks:
1. Create new button that open new options: 'task manager'.
2. when press, open input place to put the sheet name in the spreadsheet and load button.
3. when press make loading indicater.
4. meanwhile go the spreadsheet, the sheet name, and get from there the tasks list from table with 2 headers: task, description.
5. save all the tasks to the extension.
6. The user can see all the task in tasks.html (below). with button in the task manager.
```

## Implementation Plan

Based on the requirements, I need to implement enhanced task management functionality with the following features:

### Core Requirements Analysis:
1. **Task Status System** - Tasks need three states: pending, in-progress (current), completed
2. **Session-Task Association** - Each 25-minute work session should be linked to a specific task
3. **Enhanced Logging** - Log the task name alongside session data to Google Sheets
4. **UI Improvements** - Show current task name in popup and task description on hover

### Files to Modify:
- `background.js` - Add current task management, enhance logging with task names
- `popup.js` - Add current task display and hover functionality
- `popup.html` - Add current task display area
- `tasks.js` - Enhance task status management (ensure only one task can be "in-progress")

### Detailed Implementation Tasks:

#### Phase 1: Core Task Status System
- [ ] **Update task status logic in `tasks.js`**: Ensure only one task can be "in-progress" at a time
- [ ] **Add current task tracking in `background.js`**: Track which task is currently active
- [ ] **Enhance task loading in `background.js`**: Initialize task statuses when loading from Google Sheets

#### Phase 2: Session-Task Integration
- [ ] **Modify timer logic in `background.js`**: Associate each work session with the current task
- [ ] **Update logging function in `background.js`**: Include task name in session logs sent to Google Sheets
- [ ] **Add task selection logic**: Automatically use the "in-progress" task for sessions

#### Phase 3: UI Enhancements
- [ ] **Add current task display in `popup.html`**: Show current task name in the popup
- [ ] **Implement task hover functionality in `popup.js`**: Show task description on hover
- [ ] **Update popup styling**: Style the current task display area

#### Phase 4: Data Management
- [ ] **Ensure task state persistence**: Current task should persist across browser sessions
- [ ] **Handle edge cases**: What happens when no task is in-progress, multiple tasks marked as in-progress

### Dependencies:
- Task loading functionality (already implemented)
- Google Sheets integration (already implemented)
- Session logging system (already implemented)

### Expected Impact:
- **Low Risk**: Building on existing task management and logging systems
- **Medium Complexity**: Need to coordinate between multiple files and ensure state consistency
- **High Value**: Significantly improves task-session integration and user experience

### Testing Plan:
- Test task status transitions (pending → in-progress → completed)
- Verify only one task can be in-progress at a time
- Test session logging includes correct task name
- Verify current task displays in popup
- Test hover functionality for task descriptions

This implementation builds incrementally on the existing task management system while adding the requested functionality for better session-task integration.

## Implementation Log

### Phase 1: Core Task Status System ✅
**File: tasks.js** (2025-07-16)
- Modified `toggleTaskStatus` function to ensure only one task can be "in-progress" at a time
- Added logic to set other tasks to "pending" when a new task is marked as "in-progress"
- Added communication with background script to notify about current task changes
- **Impact**: Task status management now properly enforces single active task rule

### Phase 2: Session-Task Integration ✅
**File: background.js** (2025-07-16)
- Added `currentTask` variable to track the currently active task
- Added initialization logic to find and set current task from storage on extension startup
- Enhanced `fetchTasks` function to properly initialize task statuses and IDs
- Modified `startTimer` function to associate work sessions with current task
- Updated `logSession` function to include task name in Google Sheets logs
- Added message handlers for `setCurrentTask` and `getCurrentTask` commands
- **Impact**: Work sessions are now properly linked to tasks, and task names are logged to Google Sheets

### Phase 3: UI Enhancements ✅
**File: popup.html** (2025-07-16)
- Added current task display area with `<div id="currentTask">`
- Added CSS styling for current task display with green border and hover effects
- Added tooltip styling for task description display
- **Impact**: Users can now see the current task directly in the popup

**File: popup.js** (2025-07-16)
- Added `updateCurrentTaskDisplay` function to show current task in popup
- Added `setupTaskHover` function to display task description on hover
- Integrated current task display with task loading process
- **Impact**: Real-time current task display with hover descriptions

### Key Features Implemented:
1. ✅ **Single In-Progress Task**: Only one task can be "in-progress" at a time
2. ✅ **Session-Task Association**: Each work session is linked to the current task
3. ✅ **Enhanced Logging**: Task names are included in Google Sheets logs
4. ✅ **Current Task Display**: Shows current task name in popup
5. ✅ **Task Description Hover**: Displays task description when hovering over task name

### Technical Details:
- **Current Task Persistence**: Current task is maintained in memory and synced with storage
- **Task Status Management**: Automatic enforcement of single in-progress task rule
- **Google Sheets Integration**: Extended existing logging to include task names
- **UI Responsiveness**: Current task display updates automatically when tasks change

## Task Completed

**Date Completed**: 2025-07-16

**Files Modified**:
- `tasks.js` - Enhanced task status management with single in-progress enforcement
- `background.js` - Added current task tracking and session-task integration
- `popup.html` - Added current task display area with styling
- `popup.js` - Implemented current task display and hover functionality

**Solution Implemented**:
Successfully implemented enhanced task management functionality that allows users to:
1. **Manage Task Status**: Tasks now have three states (pending, in-progress, completed) with only one task allowed to be in-progress at a time
2. **Track Work Sessions**: Each 25-minute work session is automatically associated with the current in-progress task
3. **Enhanced Logging**: Session logs sent to Google Sheets now include the task name for better tracking
4. **Improved UI**: The popup now displays the current task name, and hovering over it shows the task description

**Notes for Future Work**:
- The logging function now sends 7 columns instead of 6 to Google Sheets (added task name)
- Users need to update their Google Sheets logging setup to accommodate the new task name column
- The current task persists across browser sessions and automatically syncs when tasks are loaded or updated
- Task descriptions are shown via hover tooltip for better user experience without cluttering the popup UI

## Bug Fix - Auto-Select First Task

**Issue**: After loading tasks, "No task selected" was still showing and users couldn't select a task.

**Fix Applied** (2025-07-16):
- **File**: `background.js` - Modified `fetchTasks` function
- **Change**: Added logic to automatically set the first task as "in-progress" when no task is currently active
- **Impact**: When tasks are loaded, the first task automatically becomes the current task by default, eliminating the "No task selected" state

**Code Change**:
```javascript
// If no task is in-progress, make the first task current by default
if (!hasInProgress && initializedTasks.length > 0) {
  initializedTasks[0].status = 'in-progress';
  currentTask = initializedTasks[0];
}
```

This ensures users always have a current task selected after loading tasks from Google Sheets.

## Additional Bug Fixes

### Fix 1: Cursor Hover Issue (2025-07-21)
**Issue**: When hovering over the currentTask div, users saw a hand cursor instead of the expected default or help cursor.

**Fix Applied**:
- **File**: `popup.html` - Modified CSS for `.current-task` class
- **Change**: Added `cursor: default;` to the `.current-task` CSS rule to ensure the container shows default cursor while the task name itself maintains `cursor: help;`
- **Impact**: Users now see the correct cursor behavior when hovering over the current task area

### Fix 2: View Tasks Button Persistence (2025-07-21)
**Issue**: The "View Tasks" button only appeared after loading tasks and would disappear when closing and reopening the popup, even if tasks were already loaded.

**Fix Applied**:
- **File**: `popup.js` - Added task checking on popup initialization
- **Changes**: 
  1. Added call to `checkAndShowViewTasksButton()` in the DOMContentLoaded event
  2. Created new function `checkAndShowViewTasksButton()` that checks if tasks exist in storage and shows the button accordingly
- **Impact**: The "View Tasks" button now persists correctly - it shows whenever tasks are loaded, even after closing and reopening the popup
