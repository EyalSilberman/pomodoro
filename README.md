## Google Sheets Integration Setup

### How to Set Up Google Sheets Integration

Follow these steps to connect the extension to your personal Google Sheet. This process gives you full control over your data and script.

**Part A: Create and Deploy the Google Apps Script**

1. **Go to Google Apps Script**: Open [script.google.com](https://script.google.com) and click **New project**.
2. **Paste the Code**: Delete the default `function myFunction() {...}` and paste the entire contents of the `Code.gs` file from this repository.
3. **Configure the Script**:
   * Change the value of `SECRET_KEY` to a unique, private password of your choice.
   * Find the ID of your Google Sheet. It's in the URL: `.../spreadsheets/d/THIS_IS_THE_ID/edit`. Paste this ID as the value for `SHEET_ID`.
4. **Save the Project**: Click the floppy disk icon (Save project) and give it a name like "Pomodoro Timer Logger".
5. **Deploy as a Web App**:
   * Click the blue **Deploy** button in the top-right corner and select **New deployment**.
   * Click the gear icon next to "Select type" and choose **Web app**.
   * For "Execute as", select **Me**.
   * For "Who has access", select **Anyone**. *(This is safe because we are using a `SECRET_KEY`)*.
   * Click **Deploy**.
6. **Authorize Permissions**:
   * A popup will appear asking for authorization. Click **Authorize access**.
   * Choose your Google Account.
   * You may see a "Google hasn't verified this app" screen. This is normal. Click **Advanced**, then click **Go to [Your Script Name] (unsafe)**.
   * On the final screen, review the permissions (it will ask to access your spreadsheets) and click **Allow**.
7. **Copy the Web App URL**: After deploying, a new popup will show your **Web app URL**. Copy this URL. You will need it for the extension.

**Part B: Configure the Chrome Extension**

1. Open the Chrome Extension popup.
2. Paste the **Web App URL** you just copied into the "Google Sheets Web App URL" input field.
3. Enter the same **Secret Key** you created in the script into the "Secret Key" input field.
4. Click **Save Settings**. You are now ready to log your time!
